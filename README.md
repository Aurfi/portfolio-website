- name: Run Final Integration
  run: npm run integration:final

- name: Check Quality Score
  run: |
    SCORE=$(npm run integration:final | grep "OVERALL SCORE" | grep -o '[0-9]*')
    if [ $SCORE -lt 80 ]; then
      echo "Quality score too low: $SCORE/100"
      exit 1
    fi
```

This ensures that only high-quality code reaches production, maintaining the portfolio's professional standards and optimal user experience.
